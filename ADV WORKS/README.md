# Adventure Works Sales Report using PowerBI

Hello everyone,
I am excited to share with you an incredible Power BI report that I recently created using a dataset provided by Maven Analytics. The report provides valuable insights into the sales performance of a fictional company, Adventure Works, over the past year.

The Adventure Works Dashboard Report consists of three pages:

1. Overall Sales Summary: This page presents a comprehensive overview of Adventure Works' sales performance. The report highlights that customers are placing the most orders for accessories, followed by bikes. The company is exceeding its monthly revenue target of $1.83 million, and the number of monthly orders placed is close to the target. The most popular product is the 30 oz water bottle, while the Mountain 200 Black bike is the most profitable. The USA and Australia generate the highest revenue and profit.

2. Weekly Product Details: This page provides a detailed analysis of the weekly product details for a selected product. The report shows how changing product prices impact profits and calculates the weekly profit forecast for the next 6 weeks. The radar chart reflects the current month's order, revenue, and return vs. target.

3. Customer Details: This page emphasizes customer details. The report shows an increase in orders placed and revenue generated over the years. June 2017 was the month with the highest revenue of $1.8 million. The highest revenue generated by a customer is $12,410, who belongs to the average income segment and has a professional occupation.

Overall, this report helps Adventure Works analyze their sales performance and make informed decisions to increase revenue and profitability.

Thank you for your time and attention.
